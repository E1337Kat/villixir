  This engine piece manages the money for a town. There
  are both credits and debits to the town's bank account
  each day. To keep things simple, we only consider money
  to be an integer that is opperated on by integers.
  While taxes could be a decimal point, the amount of
  income from them will be the floor of the monetary
  amount to the closest single unit of currency.
