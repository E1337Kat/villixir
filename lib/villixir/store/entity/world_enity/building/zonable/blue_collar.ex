  A blue collar building can be commercial or industrial based
  on surrounding zones. High amount of residential surrounding
  blue collar will have blue collar appear as commercial. When
  surrounded with a lot of blue collar only, then this appears
  as more industrial type. Finally, if there is little residential
  and a lot of nothing, then this will exist as more farming type
  blue collar.
